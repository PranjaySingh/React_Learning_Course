# React_Learning_Course

This Repo contains the code I wrote while learning React.js following the Udemy course.
The master branch is empty. Every new piece of code would be in a new branch. This would probably be a new react mini project, aimed at teaching me new concepts in react, hopefully uploaded daily.
